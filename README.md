 sentiment-analysis-model-deployment

In this project, I have used Amazon SageMaker to complete an entire lifecycle of a machine learning project. The goal is to build a very simple web page in which a user can submit a movie review and the model will predict whether the review is POSITIVE or NEGATIVE review. The prediction model is trainned on IMDB dataset and it was implemented in Pytorch.
